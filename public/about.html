<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Upama Pradhan, currently in my second year of B.Tech at JIS University, Kolkata, 
  where I’m majoring in Computer Science Engineering. Lately, I’ve been exploring web development, 
  and it’s been such a thrilling experience. At first, it seemed a bit overwhelming with all the new concepts and tools, 
  but once I got the hang of it, I found the whole process incredibly fun. The more I learn, 
  the more I realize how much I can create and customize, and that’s what keeps me motivated to dive deeper.</p>

<p>What I enjoy most about web development is the blend of creativity and technical skill. 
  It’s like solving puzzles while designing something that looks good and works smoothly. 
  I’m constantly amazed at how a few lines of code can transform into a fully functional, interactive webpage.
   The sense of accomplishment I get after completing a project is unmatched, 
   and it’s driving me to explore new frameworks and technologies.</p>
  
<p>Though I’m still at the beginning of my web development journey,
   I’m excited about the possibilities. With every new project, 
   I feel like I’m gaining a better understanding of how the web works, and it’s motivating me to push my limits.
    There’s so much more to learn, and I’m looking forward to applying these skills in real-world scenarios.
     The future looks promising, and I can’t wait to see where this path takes me!</p>
